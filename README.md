COmpile-Run-DElete-Loop is a utility to make running C/C++ program(s) over and over again less tedious. It's a personal tool that I use with competitive programming, and it allowed me to try out Rust's trait system.
This project used to be in a private gitlab repository, it was uploaded all at once.
